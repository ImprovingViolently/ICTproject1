# ICTproject1

This project is my first major C# project, which I am not very proud of.

Have fun looking through this, Future Gibbon!

# Documentation

For ease of expansion/repurposing, I am going to release a full list of methods and other information on this github page.

# Explanation

This project originally had no purpose and was intended to be a way to explore C# as a language, but has since evolved. Some of the code is spaghetti and comments are all over the place, but it is my first proper project and as such should be looked at as such.
